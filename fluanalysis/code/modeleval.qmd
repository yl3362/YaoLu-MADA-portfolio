# Setup
```{r, include=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
knitr::read_chunk('modeleval.R')
```

Load package
```{r,package}
```
Load data
```{r,data}
```
Fit the model use all predictor
```{r,fit}
```
Predict
```{r,predict}
```

Fit the model only use main predictor
```{r,fit2}
```

Predict in alternative model
```{r,predict2}
```

# Summary
In the model using all predictors, area under the curve is 0.787 for train_data. It's a fine model.
For test_data, that's 0.724. It's fine as well.

In the model using the main predictor, area under the curve is 0.519 for train_data. So, this isn't a good model.
For test_data, that's 0.466. This indicate that isn't a good model.
